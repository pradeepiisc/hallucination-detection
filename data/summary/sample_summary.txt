The city council has announced a comprehensive green initiative designed to tackle air pollution and enhance environmental sustainability. Key components of the plan involve planting 10,000 trees, expanding bike lanes, and boosting the availability of electric vehicle charging stations. Mayor Jane Smith highlighted the critical role of community participation in ensuring the initiative's success. Interestingly, the initiative also includes a controversial plan to reduce public transportation services, which has raised concerns among residents. The project will commence next month, starting with the most polluted urban areas.
